    <string name="topic_1_content">
        The goal of Sudoku is to fill a 9x9 grid with numbers so that each row, column and 3x3 section contain all of the digits between 1 and 9.\n\n
        1. **Row**: A horizontal line of 9 cells.\n
        2. **Column**: A vertical line of 9 cells.\n
        3. **Box**: A 3x3 sub-grid area.\n\n
        At the beginning of the game, the 9x9 grid will have some of the squares filled in. You cannot change these initial numbers.

    <string name="topic_2_content">
        This is the most basic strategy. When you look at a specific cell, check its Row, Column, and Box.\n\n
        If 8 different numbers already exist in these areas combined, the current cell MUST be the remaining 9th number.\n\n
        Example: If a row has 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8, the empty spot must be 9.

    <string name="topic_3_content">
        Instead of looking at a cell, look at a number (e.g., \"1\"). Focus on a 3x3 Box.\n\n
        Check the rows and columns passing through that box. If they already contain a \"1\", those positions in the box are blocked.\n\n
        If only one cell remains in that box that isn\'t blocked, that cell MUST contain the \"1\".

    <string name="about_story_content">
        Most Sudoku apps focus only on solving puzzles, but I wanted to create something different. Sudoku Genius was born from the idea that logic is a skill that can be taught.\n\n
        Designed with a focus on clean UI and educational value, this app aims to help players understand the "Why" behind every move, transforming beginners into masters through practice and learning.
